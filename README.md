**GWater2** Is a fluid simulation mod for Garry's Mod. It adds the ability to spawn and create a multitude of different liquids that flow in real time.\
Due to the complex nature of simulating and rendering fluid dynamics, the backend of this mod requires a binary module.

# Features
**GWater2** comes with a bunch of SWEPs and Entities to mess with, and a menu to change fluid behavior.\
Multiplayer is supported, and menu options (fluid parameters) are synced.

Features include:
- The fastest fluid rendering achieved inside sourceengine
- Reaction Forces (Water can force objects around)
- Swimming / player interactions with liquids
- Liquid sounds
- Foam & bubble particles
- Multiplayer support
- Spawnable dynamic cloth
- Custom menu, with:
	- Multiplayer syncing
	- Lots of options and settings to mess with
	- Preset saving
	- Language localization support
- Custom SWEPs, including:
	- Water gun, modeled by me
	- Part the seas, now you can roleplay as moses!
	- Advanced water gun (courtesy of googer_)
- Custom SENTs, including:
	- Black hole (forcefield variant)
	- Bluetooth hose
	- Spawnable liquid cubes, spheres and cloth
	- Drain (removes water)
	- Emitter (creates water)
	- Forcefield (forces water around)
	- Mentos with cola (from GWater1)
	- Rain Emitter (minature rainclouds)
	- Shower head (smaller emitter)
	- Transmuter (turns entities into water)
	- Transporter (linked drain and emitter)

# Requirements
> [!IMPORTANT]
> In order to run **GWater2** you MUST have a DirectX11 capable graphics card

A capable card must have:\
`Nvidia Driver version 396.45` (or higher)\
OR\
`AMD Software version 16.9.1` (or higher)\
OR\
`Intel® Graphics version 15.33.43.4425` (or higher)

If this is all gibberish to you, essentially any graphics card manufactured later than 2012 will work just fine.

# Installation

### For Normal Users:
1. Go to the [releases tab](https://github.com/meetric1/gwater2/releases) and read the instructions

### For Developers:
1. cd to `GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons/`
2. run `git clone https://github.com/meetric1/gwater2` in a terminal.
3. Unsubscribe to the workshop version if you have it installed
4. If you wish to work on the C++, make sure to clone recursively. See [Compilation](#compilation) for more info

# Technical details
Unlike most other Garry's mod addons, **GWater2** uses a binary module. The GLua API, although impressive, isn't powerful enough to simulate and render fluid dynamics.

Backend particle physics is calculated via [Nvidia FleX](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/FleX), a GPU accelerated particle system for liquids.\
Custom shaders were created in HLSL, compiled using [ShaderCompile](https://github.com/SCell555/ShaderCompile), and are injected during runtime.

# Compilation

### Module compilation
This repository is set up with a [github actions](https://github.com/meetric1/gwater2/actions), which automatically compiles new modules for you.\
Feel free to download new module versions from there.

Compiled modules should go in `GarrysMod/garrysmod/lua/bin`.

> [!WARNING]
>  This repo is quite large (upwards of 1 gb), as it includes some submodules needed for compilation

> [!WARNING]
> Extremely new versions of visual studio may cause errors during compilation. This can be fixed by manually altering the gmcommon source code or by using vs2019

If you wish to compile it yourself, simply follow these steps.
1. *Recursively* clone this repository into your desired folder. 
	- Example command: `git clone https://github.com/meetric1/gwater2 --recursive`
2. Download [premake5](https://premake.github.io/download)
	- If you are on Windows, add the executable to PATH or copy it into this repositories `binary` directory 
		- If copied correctly, premake5.exe should be in the same folder as premake5.lua
	- On Linux, you should just be able to install it via your package manager. If that doesn't work, just download it directly, chmod the executable, and place it into `binary`
3. CD into the repositories `binary` directory and run `premake5` with your desired build system. 
	- I use Visual Studio 2022, so I would do `premake5 vs2022`
	- Linux users would do `./premake5 gmake`
	- [List of supported build systems](https://premake.github.io/docs/Using-Premake#using-premake-to-generate-project-files)
		- I am honestly unsure how new your build system needs to be. I'd personally just make sure to use vs2015 or later
4. Now, build the project like normal.
   - On Windows, open the .sln file, go to the top taskbar, Build -> Build Solution
   - On Linux, run `make config=release_x86_64`

> [!TIP]
> If you need help with compiling, feel free to look at the github workflow source code

> [!NOTE]
> By default, this repo builds for the x86-64 branch of GMod. If you wish to compile for the main branch, you will need to remove the gmcommon submodule and *recursively* re-clone the main branch version, found [here](https://github.com/danielga/garrysmod_common).\
> After that, you will need to add a preprocessor definition, `GMOD_MAIN`. This can be done in visual studio by going to the project properties -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions

>[!NOTE]
> Linux builds end in `.dll` __THIS IS INTENTIONAL!__ Blame Garry for the weird syntax

> [!CAUTION]
> Although Linux builds successfully, it throws errors during runtime, which I do not know how to fix. (pls help)\
> See https://github.com/meetric1/gwater2/issues/1 for more information

### Shader compilation
Custom shaders were created in HLSL, and compiled using [ShaderCompile](https://github.com/SCell555/ShaderCompile).

# Translating
The **GWater2** menu supports language localization.\
If you wish to translate, clone (or download) this repo, and go to `data_static/gwater2/locale/`\
Find out your language id by doing `gmod_language` in the gmod console.\
Then, copy `gwater2_en.txt`, rename it `gwater2_<LANGUAGE ID>` and start translating.\
Once done, make a PR here, make a discussion on the steam page, or DM me on [discord](https://discord.gg/xWvhfargMY)

**Please refrain from using ChatGPT for translations, as it usually messes up sentence inflection**

Thanks to these people for translating the menu into their native language.
